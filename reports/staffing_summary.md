## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize steps with largest gaps**: Focus staffing increases on steps showing consistent headcount gaps.
2. **Peak hour coverage**: Ensure adequate staffing during peak hours identified in top gaps.
3. **Cross-training**: Consider cross-training associates to enable flexible reallocation across steps.
4. **Capacity planning**: Review capacity constraints that may require equipment or process improvements beyond staffing.
